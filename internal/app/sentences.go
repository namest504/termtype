	"The Trump administration heads to the US Supreme Court on Wednesday, facing off against small businesses and a group of states who contend most of the tariffs it has put in place are illegal and should be struck down.",
	"If the court agrees with them, Trump's trade strategy would be upended, including the sweeping global tariffs he first announced in April.",
	"The government would also likely have to refund some of the billions of dollars it has collected through the tariffs, which are taxes on imports.",

	"His co-op, which imports coffee from more than a dozen countries, has already paid roughly $1.3m in tariffs since April.",
	"In deciding this case, the Supreme Court will have to take on a broader question: How far does presidential power go?",
	"Legal analysts say it is hard to predict the justices' answer, but a ruling siding with Trump will give him and future White House occupants greater reach.",
	"Specifically, the case concerns tariffs that the Trump administration imposed using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the White House has embraced for its speed and flexibility.",
	"By declaring an emergency under the law, Trump can issue immediate orders and bypass longer, established processes.",
	"Trump first invoked the law in February to tax goods from China, Mexico and Canada, saying drug trafficking from those countries constituted an emergency.",
	"He deployed it again in April, ordering levies ranging from 10% to 50% on goods from almost every country in the world.",
	"This time, he said the US trade deficit - where the US imports more than it exports - posed an 'extraordinary and unusual threat'.",

	"This is not just about the money,",
	"The president has announced tariffs on Sunday that go into effect on Wednesday, without advance notice, without any real process.",
	"I think that's the bigger thing for this case for businesses - whether or not that is going to be in our future,",
	"There is no clear sign of how the court will rule.",
	"In recent years it has struck down major policies, such as Biden-era student loan forgiveness, as White House overreach.",
	"But the nine justices, six of whom were appointed by Republicans, including three by Trump, have shown deference to this president in other recent disputes and historically have given leeway to the White House on questions of national security.",

	"Adam White, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he expected the court to strike down the tariffs, but avoid questions like what constitutes a national emergency.",

    "Should K-beauty products have to come from South Korea?",
    "Korean skincare or 'K-beauty' products are very popular around the world.",
    "But as exports from South Korea hit $10.3bn (£7.7bn) last year, cosmetics companies in other countries have introduced their own K-beauty ranges that are not Korean-made.",
    "Does this blurring of the definition matter?",
    "K-beauty products first came to international attention in the 2010s, part of a wave of other Korean exports, such as K-pop and K-drama.",
    "The K-beauty skincare regime can be very elaborate, involving as many as 10 different steps, each requiring a separate product.",
    "This caught the imagination of people around the world, and sales rose sharply.",
    "Annual exports from South Korea increased from $650m in 2011 to $4bn in 2017, according to official figures, a sixfold rise in just six years.",
    "Recognising this huge jump in demand, cosmetics brand Seoul Ceuticals was launched in 2017, named after the South Korean capital.",
    "We started to see this increase in growth in interest in K-beauty, and began developing a skincare brand to meet that demand… when we really saw it emerging in the US,",
    "It has been extremely successful.",
    "We expect to do over $14m in sales in 2025.",
    "We've seen a global acceptance and demand for the K-beauty products.",
    "We've started selling in India, Latin America, Europe and Australia.",
    "But Seoul Ceuticals is not a Korean company.",
    "It is based in the US, where it also manufacturers all its products.",
    "The business doesn't claim to be Korean, but it does say that it makes 'real, authentic Korean skincare'.",
    "That may sound like a contradiction, but the company says it isn't because its ingredients are sourced from South Korea.",
    "I think we were a little more sensitive about it when we were first starting, because we wanted to be very transparent that the products are made in the US,",
    "[But] we source our ingredients in Korea… we wanted to be able to legitimately say we are a K-beauty brand.",
    "But not everyone would agree with this.",
    "The products should be manufactured by a Korean manufacturer,",
    "He runs the business with his wife Elisa Ahonpää-Kim.",
    "While they are based in Finland, all of their team except Elisa are Korean, and all their products are made in South Korea.",
    "The most important thing that we both absolutely agree is that the brand should develop its concept, and ideas, and products with a Korean perspective,",
    "That can come through in the ingredients, the design.",
    "Or cultural elements, basically anything that clearly connects to the brands to Korea, or at least reflects a Korean influence.",
    "However, the couple do admit that the definition of K-beauty remains complex.",
    "I guess it's a very vague concept, because on the market you will find a lot of brands that are made by Koreans who live abroad,",
    "And then brands like Lancôme and Clinique manufacture their products in Korea and Japan, but then it doesn't make those brands Japanese and Korean.",
    "There is currently no official definition of K-beauty.",
    "And there is no protected designation of origin to defend it, like in the case of Champagne or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.",
    "And there is no plan to set one up, according to the K-beauty Industry Association, the only K-beauty trade body officially approved by the South Korean government.",
    "We are currently more focused in promoting and expanding K-beauty,",
    "While the trend is quite established in Asia, it is only just starting in Europe and the US, and we don't want to throttle the growth by imposing any sanctions on them.",
    "However, the association does have rules for its members – they must be companies that are registered in South Korea, and their products must be officially tested and approved by Korea Food & Drug Administration.",
    "That approval is required in order to sell inside South Korea.",
    "If a product is developed in a way that suits the climate and environment of Korea, and is recognized as a viable product in the Korean market, then we would acknowledge it as K-beauty,",
    "Hwarangpoom agrees with this definition, and has received approval from KFDA.",
    "And Seoul Ceuticals has also started the process to attain KFDA approval, to bring their products to Korean consumers.",
    "With K-beauty exports from South Korea in 2024 20% higher than in 2023, there is a lot of money to be made in the sector whether the firms are homegrown or not.",
    "In fact, South Korea is now the largest exporter of cosmetic products after France and the US.",
    "However, this success has spawned counterfeiters.",
    "Mark Lee is the CEO of MarqVision, a US-based business helps firms spot fakes and get them removed from sale.",
    "For a major Korean beauty brand, which I cannot disclose, we recently conducted 29 test purchases across major US marketplaces,",
    "Twenty six of them were fake.",
    "So that's a 90% counterfeit rate.",
    "And in 2024 as a whole, Marqvision identified $280m worth of fake K-beauty products in the US market alone.",
    "The high number of counterfeits greatly frustrated K-beauty fan Gracie Tullio.",
    "Shopping online for K-beauty was a really scary experience,",
    "This led to London-based Ms Tullio launching PureSeoul in 2019, a K-beauty retail business that sells authentic products sourced directly from Korean manufacturers.",
    "She says she gets customers who visit the shop with suspected fake products to check if they are real.",
    "Even our customers can be sometimes tempted by the lower price [of online fakes].",
    "It's so tempting for them just to give it a go and see, and nine times out of 10, it's not real,",
    "The striking Swedish workers taking on carmaker Tesla",
    "How the outsourcing sector became South Africa's newest goldmine",

    "Chris Wright says the tests will be 'non-critical explosions', meaning that Americans would not be seeing mushroom clouds.",
    "'No idea who he is,' says Trump after pardoning crypto tycoon",
    "The president pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the co-founder of the world's largest crypto exchange, in October.",
	"Publishers fear AI summaries are hitting online traffic",
	"When actress Sorcha Cusack left the BBC drama Father Brown in January, it made headlines, including for the newspapers owned by Reach, among them The Mirror, and the Daily Express.",
	"But the story did not generate the traction the Reach newspapers would have expected a year ago, or even at the start of the year.",
	"Reach put this down to AI Overviews (AIO) – the AI summary at the top of the Google results page.",
	"Instead of clicking through to the story on a Reach newspaper site, readers were happy with the AI overview.",
	"The feature is a concern for newspapers and other media publishers, who have already seen much of their advertising revenue siphoned off by social media.",
	"In a tough market, readers coming via Google search is a valuable source of traffic.",
	"A major worry, backed by some individual datapoints, has been that AI overviews would lead to fewer people clicking through to the content behind them, with negative knock-on effects for publishers,",
	"He points out that it's hard to know the full effect of AI overviews, without independent access to Google's, or publishers', internal data on click-through rates.",
	"DMG Media, owner of MailOnline, Metro and other outlets, said AIO resulted in a fall in click-through-rates by as much as 89%, in a statement to the Competition and Markets Authority made in July.",
	"It means publishers are not being fairly rewarded for their work, says David Higgerson, chief digital publisher at Reach.",
	"Publishers provide the accurate, timely, trustworthy content that basically fuels Google, and in return we get a click… that hopefully we can monetise to our subscription service.",
	"Now with Google Overviews it's reducing the need for somebody to click through to us in the first place, but for no financial benefit for the publisher.",
	"It's another example of the distributor of information not being the creator of information but taking all the financial reward for it.",
	"There is also concern over Google's new tool called AI Mode, which shows search results in a conversational style with far fewer links than traditional search.",
	"If Google flips onto full AI Mode, and there is a big uptake in that…that [will be] completely quite devastating for the industry,",
	"We are definitely moving into the era of lower clicks and lower referral traffic for publishers,",
	"For most of the last decade Google has introduced more and more features into the SERP [Search Engine Results Page], which reduces the need for consumers to visit a website.",
	"That is the challenge that we as a sector face.",
	"Mr Forrest says he hasn't noticed a drop in traffic across Bauer's sites, which include brands Grazia and Empire, as a result of the overview feature.",
	"But that could change.",
	"I absolutely think that as time goes on, as consumers get used to these panels, it's without doubt going to be a challenge.",
	"We are absolutely behaving as if we have to respond to that threat.",
	"In its defence, a Google spokesperson said: 'More than any other company, Google prioritises sending traffic to the web, and we continue to send billions of clicks to websites every day.'",
	"In an August blog post, Google's head of search Liz Reid said the volume of clicks from Google search to websites had been 'relatively stable' year-over-year.",
	"She also said the number of quality of clicks had improved slightly compared to a year ago - quality clicks are when a user does not immediately click back from the link.",
	"With AI Overviews, people are searching more and asking new questions that are often longer and more complex.",
	"In addition, with AI Overviews people are seeing more links on the page than before.",
	"More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked,",
	"Some in the publishing industry are turning to the courts for redress.",
	"In July, a group of organisations including the Independent Publishers Alliance, tech justice non-profit Foxglove, and the campaign group Movement for an Open Web filed a legal complaint to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority alleging that Google AI Overviews is using publishers' content at a cost to the newspapers.",
	"It is asking the CMA to introduce interim measures to prevent Google from 'misusing' publisher content in AI-generated responses.",
	"In the meantime publishers are trying to understand how to feature in AIO and hopeful win some click-throughs.",
	"Google doesn't give us a manual on how to do it.",
	"We have to run tests and optimise copy in a way that doesn't damage the primary purpose of the content, which is to satisfy a reader's desire for information,",
	"We need to make sure that it's us being cited and not our rivals,",
	"Things like writing good quality content… it's amazing the number of publishers that just give up on that.",
	"Like other publishers, Reach is looking at other ways to build traffic to its news platforms.",
	"We need to go and find where audiences are elsewhere and build relationships with them there.",
	"We've got millions of people who receive our alerts on WhatsApp,",
	"We've built newsletters.",
	"It's all about giving people what they want when they're on our website and our brand, so the next time they're looking, hopefully they aren't going to a third party to get to us.",
	"Why employees smuggle AI into work",
	"Trucking's uneasy relationship with new tech",
	"Will new greener brake pads be more expensive?",
	"What's the big deal about AI data centres?",
	"It's such a big number that it's hard to imagine.",
	"Worldwide, around $3tn (£2.2tn) will be spent on data centres that support AI between now and 2029.",
	"That estimate comes from the investment bank Morgan Stanley, which adds that roughly half of that sum will go on construction costs, and half on the pricey hardware supporting the AI revolution.",
	"To put that number into perspective, that's roughly what the entire French economy was worth in 2024.",
	"In the UK alone, it's estimated that another 100 data centres will be built over the next few years to meet the demand for AI processing.",
	"Some of those will be built for Microsoft which earlier this month announced $30bn (£22bn) investment in the UK's AI sector.",
	"Just what is it about AI data centres that's different from the traditional building containing ranks of computer servers that keeps our personal photos, social media accounts and work applications humming away?",
	"And are they worth this terrific spending spree?",
	"Data centres have been growing in size for years.",
	"A new term, hyperscale, was coined by the tech industry to describe sites where the power requirement runs into tens of megawatts, before gigawatts, a thousand times bigger than megawatts, came on the scene.",
	"But AI has supercharged this game.",
	"Most AI models rely on expensive computer chips from Nvidia to process tasks.",
	"Nvidia chips come in large cabinets costing around $4m each.",
	"And these cabinets hold the key to why AI data centres are different.",
	"The Large Language Models (LLMs) that train up AI software have to break language into every possible tiny element of meaning.",
	"That is only possible with a network of computers working in unison and in extremely close proximity.",
	"Why is proximity so important?",
	"Every metre of distance between two chips adds a nanosecond, one billionth of a second, to the processing time.",
	"It might not sound like much time, but when a warehouse full of computers is whirring away these microscopic delays pile up and dilute the performance needed for AI.",
	"The AI processing cabinets are jammed in together to eliminate this element of latency and create what the tech sector calls parallel processing, operating as one enormous computer.",
	"It all spells out density, a magic word in AI construction circles.",
	"Density eliminates the processing bottlenecks that regular data centres see from working with processors sitting several metres apart.",
	"However, those dense ranks of cabinets eat up gigawatts of power and LLM training produces spikes in that appetite for electricity.",
	"These spikes are equivalent to thousands of homes switching kettles on and off in unison every few seconds.",
	"This type of irregular demand on a local grid needs to be carefully managed.",
	"Normal data centres are a steady hum in the background compared to the demand an AI workload makes on the grid.",
	"Just like those synchronised kettles, sudden AI surges present what Mr Bizo calls a singular problem.",
	"The singular workload at this scale is unheard of,",
	"it's such an extreme engineering challenge, it's like the Apollo programme.",
	"Data centre operators are getting around the energy problem in various ways.",
	"Speaking to the BBC earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that in the UK in the short term he was hoping that more gas turbines could be used 'off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid'.",
	"He said AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost effective sustainable energy.",
	"Microsoft is investing billions of dollars in energy projects, including a deal with Constellation Energy that will see nuclear power produced again on Three Mile Island.",
	"Google, owned by Alphabet, is also investing in nuclear power as part of a strategy to run on carbon-free energy by 2030.",
	"Meanwhile Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is part of the retail giant Amazon, says it is already the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world.",
	"The data centre industry is acutely aware that legislators are keeping an eye on the downsides of AI factories with their intense energy use having a potential impact on local infrastructure and the environment.",
	"One of these environmental impacts includes a hefty supply of water to cool toiling chips.",
	"In the US state of Virginia, home to an expanding population of data centres that keep tech giants like Amazon and Google in business, a bill tying approval of new sites to water consumption figures is under consideration.",
	"Meanwhile a proposed AI factory in northern Lincolnshire in the UK has run into objections from Anglian Water, which is responsible for keeping taps on in the area of the proposed site.",
	"Anglian Water points out that it is not obliged to supply water for non-domestic use and suggests recycled water from the final stage of effluent treatment as a coolant rather than drinking water.",
	"Given the practical problems and enormous costs AI data centres face, is the whole movement really one big bubble?",
	"One speaker at recent data centre conference coined the term 'bragawatts' to describe how the industry is talking up the scale of proposed AI sites.",
	"Zahl Limbuwala is a data centre specialist at tech investment advisors DTCP.",
	"He acknowledges big questions around the future of AI data centre spending.",
	"The current trajectory is very difficult to believe.",
	"There has certainly been a lot of bragging going on.",
	"But investment has to deliver a return or the market will correct itself.",
	"Bearing these cautions in mind, he still believes AI merits a special place in investment terms.",
	"AI will have more impact than previous technologies, including the internet.",
	"So it's feasible we'll need all those gigawatts.",
	"He notes that bragging apart, AI data centres 'are the real estate of the tech world.'",
	"Speculative tech bubbles such as the dotcom boom of the 1990s lacked a bricks and mortar base.",
